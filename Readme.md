# Breast Cancer Predictor with AI-Generated Precautions

This project is a web application built using Streamlit that predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on cell nucleus measurements from the breast cancer dataset. In addition to making predictions, the app also provides AI-generated health precautions using Google's Generative AI (Gemini).

## Features
- **Breast Cancer Prediction**: Predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant using various cell nucleus measurements.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Users can adjust sliders to provide their own measurements for prediction.
- **AI-Generated Precautions**: After the prediction, the app uses Google Gemini AI to suggest personalized health precautions.
- **Visualizations**: Provides a radar chart to compare cell nucleus measurements across categories (mean, standard error, worst).
